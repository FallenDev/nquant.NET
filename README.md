# nquant.NET   

## nQuant.NET is a color quantizer producing high quality indexed PNG images.   
nQuant was originally developed as part of a larger effort called "RequestReduce" which is an HTTP module that automatically minified and merged CSS as well as their sprites on the fly.   
The original repository has been deleted but can be found using "TheWayBack Machine" look up https://nquant.codeplex.com/   

## This Fork   
This fork was made using the newer .NET 7. The command line project and test projects were removed. However, the original code has been changed minimally. Thus this library should plugin whereever it was used prior without much refactoring.   

## License   
nQuant.NET has retained the original Apache 2.0 license.
